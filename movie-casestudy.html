      <h1>Case Study for MovieFlix</h1>
      <img src="./projects-images/angular-myflix.png" alt="movieflix-angular" />
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MovieFlix is a library of movies from various genres and directors, with
        descriptions and plots. The project consists of a backend API and two
        frontend clients, one created with React and one with Angular. The
        backend is based on a database created with MongoDB, as well as the API
        that allows apps to interact with the database. <br />
        The frontend clients allow users to browse for movies, view details
        about them, add them in their favorites section and manage their user
        profile, giving them a chance to modify their personal information or
        delete their account
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Purpose and Objective</h2>
      <p>
        I built this personal project in the context of a CareerFoundry course
        to master full-stack web development. <br />
        <br />
        The goal was to create a fully functional, responsive and engaging web
        app. The challenge was to build an API from scratch, set up and connect
        a database, as well as make use of the most popular frontend JavaScript
        libraries/frameworks – React and Angular – to create engaging
        interactive user interfaces. <br />
        At the same time the project was set up to produce a great portfolio
        project and get used to common project requirements like user stories
        and user flows.

      <h3>Back-end</h3>

          <img
            src="./projects-images/movieapi.png"
            alt="Code snippet picture"
          />
          <p>
            For the server side I created a RESTful API using
            <b>Node.js and Express</b> as well as a non-relational database
            using MongoDB. The API allows to retrieve data about movies and
            users from the database through common HTTP requests and returns
            JSON. <br />
            API and database are connected by the business logic layer, using
            Mongoose.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="backend-item">
          <img src="./projects-images/postman.png" alt="Postman screenshot" />
          <p>
            I also implemented a login endpoint with basic HTTP authentication
            returning a authorization JWT (token) to the client. This is
            necessary to ensure only logged in users can access the database.
            <br />
            The structure and test of the endpoint was the most challenging part
            of the project for me, but at the end everything started to make
            sense and became clear and functional. To test the endpoints I used
            <b>Postman</b>.

        <h4>React Client</h4>
        <img
          src="./projects-images/myflix_client.png"
          alt="React client home"
        />
        <p>
          Later on I created another client accessing the same API and database.
          This time I used Angular framework. It is again a single-page,
          responsive web application with mostly the same functionality as the
          React client, just a very different technology and new layout. In this
          version, after registration/login, there is just one main view with a
          slider to display all moves. From there modals can be opened to
          display details about a style or source, as well as to edit the user
          profile. <br />
          <br />
          This was one of the most challenging, but at the same time very
          rewarding part for me as there was a lot to learn starting off with
          React. Compared to pure/classical HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is a
          very different approach to interface creation and design. There were
          many topics I had to research, experiment with and figure out.
        </p>

          display details about a genre or director, as well as a component
          designed to edit the user personal information.
          <br />
          <br />
          Developing with Angular was different. It is a big and vast framework,
          which means it comes with a lot more pre-defined structure and
          built-in functionality. But as soon as I started to understand the
          basic structure it started to make a lot of sense and recreating the
          client was actually quite fast.
