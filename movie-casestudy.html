      <h1>Case Study for MovieFlix</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MovieFlix is a library of movies from various genres and directors, with
        descriptions and plots. The project consists of a backend API and two
        frontend clients, one created with React and one with Angular. The
        backend is based on a database created with MongoDB, as well as the API
        that allows apps to interact with the database. <br />
        The frontend clients allow users to browse for movies, view details
        about them, add them in their favorites section and manage their user
        profile, giving them a chance to modify their personal information or
        delete their account
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Purpose and Objective</h2>
      <p>
        I built this personal project in the context of a CareerFoundry course
        to master full-stack web development. <br />
        <br />
        The goal was to create a fully functional, responsive and engaging web
        app. The challenge was to build an API from scratch, set up and connect
        a database, as well as make use of the most popular frontend JavaScript
        libraries/frameworks – React and Angular – to create engaging
        interactive user interfaces. <br />
        At the same time the project was set up to produce a great portfolio
        project and get used to common project requirements like user stories
        and user flows.
